--- PROBLEM SOLVING AND DEBUGGING ---

1) PROBLEM SOLVING:-
four steps to solve a problem:
1. understand the problem well and ask questions about the problem and solution.
2. use divide and conquer rule to solve problems it means that divide the large problem into smaller sub problem and then tackle each sub problem individually.
3. research means find the solution from google, stackoverflow or mdn etc.
4. write pseudu code before implementing the problem.

2) DEBUGGING:-
1. identify the bugs.
2. find the bugs.
3. fix the bugs.
4. prevent the bugs.
